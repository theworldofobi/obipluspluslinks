## Obi++ Resource Guide for C++ Developers

Welcome to my official repository for resources to get started with C++ software development. Below is a list of book, video, and website recommendations of useful information to get started. They are ordered roughly by level of complexity within their respective categories. Prefer to read through the written content thoroughly and use the videos as content primers. Take notes! No AI summaries around here... Be sure to stretch your brain and think of ways to apply what you have learned to meaningful projects. Happy learning!

NOTE: For university students, most of the books I have listed are accessible **for free** through the [O'Reilly Learning Platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/). Try logging in with your student ID!
